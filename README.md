## Objective: Mastering Principal Component Analysis

### 1. Theoretical Mastery

    - dimensionality reduction (transform correlated to uncorrelated principal component)
    - decompose covariance matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors
    - explained variance ratio & selecting optimal number of components
    - matrix factorization
    - singular value decomposition as alternative computation

### 2. Algorithmic Implementation

    - normalize features + handle missing values + outliers
    - use scikit-learn to compute principal components
    - create covariance and correlation matrices for PCA analysis
    - integrate PCA outputs into portfolio allocation algorithms to minimize risk and maximize returns

### 3. Performance Analysis

    - variance retention (total variance captured by top components)
    - portfolio diversification metrics
    - risk and return profiles of PCA-optimized vs traditional portfolios

### Advanced PCA techniques

    - Kernel PCA (non-linear extensions of PCA using kernel methods)
    - Sparse PCA (enforcing sparsity constraints)
    - Robust PCA( handle datasets with noise and outliers effectively)
    - Dynamic PCA in Finance (rolling PCA for time-varying finance datasets to capture changing market trends)
